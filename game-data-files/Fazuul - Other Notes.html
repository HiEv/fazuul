This is the area I haven't organized yet.. but since I wanted to post my website ASAP, I just dumped the last of my notes here.  Enjoy!

<H3>Monoliths</H3>
On the monoliths in the northeast jungle, we get different coordinates.  These are as follows:<BR>
COORDINATE 1, DIGIT 1: 4<BR>
COORDINATE 1, DIGIT 2: 4<BR>
COORDINATE 1, DIGIT 4: 8<BR>
COORDINATE 2, DIGIT 3: 9<BR>
COORDINATE 2, DIGIT 2: 0<BR>
COORDINATE 3, DIGIT 1: 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; (NEXT EXIT, 49 MILES
)<BR>
COORDINATE 3, DIGIT 3: 5<BR>
COORDINATE 3, DIGIT 4: 7<BR>
<BR>
This gives us three coordinates with 4 missing digits:  (1: 44?8), (2: ?09?), (3: 6?57)
<BR><BR>
Also on a monolith:<BR>
Statues come and statues go, and<BR>
Statues may be dumb, you know<BR>
But statues always tell the truth.<BR>
Heed them, for eternal youth.

<H3>Voices</H3>
Listening to the voices (Ground Floor of City - Room #303) gives the following information:<BR><BR>
The <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#bork">bork</A> is very sensitive to telepathic influence<BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">Alludes to the command 'think of ____'</FONT><BR>
A gwirg is a humanoid's best friend<BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">The gwirg is a tiny creature that roams around the jungle, directing humans to the oolgorboid (Room #238)</FONT><BR>
For <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#mongoo">mongoo</A> madness, put a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#torkus">torkus</A> and a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#gwingus">gwingus</A> together<BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">Shows that items can be created with other items</FONT><BR>
The granfalloon will often accept a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#mongoo">mongoo</A><BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">This confirms what is written on the alien spaceship (see below)</FONT><BR>
Beware the <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#scroom">scroom</A><BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">The scroom is clearly a gun-like weapon (see below)</FONT><BR>
Examine a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#wigglesnort">wigglesnort</A><BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">Shows that it is a hexagon shape and used for the hexagon slot outside the transporter (City Floor 1 - #290)</FONT><BR>
Try the <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#frakkle">frakkle</A> in the transporter<BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">Shows that all egg related items work in transporter</FONT><BR>
Try the products of the granfalloon in the ribbenfratz<BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">Shows what items can be used for movies (see below)</FONT><BR><BR>
The coils need a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#torkus">torkus</A> to clear their quantum field windings<BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">Seems to reference the coils (City Floor 2 - #342), but the question remains <i>how?</I></FONT><BR>
The <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#bagloon">bagloon</A> only works if you point it at an atom<BR>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#339911">Not sure what the bagloon does, nor what atom to point it at</FONT>

<BR><BR><HR>
<H3>Platform</H3>
Standing on the Platform (Jungle - Room #77) shows the following view:<BR>
Your field of view is suddenly filled with a vision of a spaceport city... huge starships appear lined up in berths extending far into the distance to the east, and the air is filled with flying craft of every possible sort and description.  All at once a small craft approaches you at a steep angle and lands next to you on the platform.  The side of the craft abruptly parts, and a five-tentacled alien climbs out and undulates away toward the city.  Looking inside the ship for the controls, you notice that it seems to have none, but there is a set of tables inscribed into one wall.  You notice that the tables seem to consist of numbers, inscribed in groups of four, three groups per line in each case followed by some cryptic cuneiform writing.  As you lean forward to examine the tables more closely, you feel yourself losing your balance, and falling... falling... falling... and then the vision has passed and you find that you have fallen off the platform.
 
<BR><BR><HR>
<H3>Colored Buttons</H3>
Pushing the colored buttons (City - Floor 3 - Room #322) in the right order seems to do something good.  After pushing certain buttons you hear a *whir*.  The order that seemed to work was Blue, Green, Purple, Red, Yellow.  After doing this, the right light was lit.

<BR><BR><HR>
<H3>Alien Spaceship (NW)</H3>
There is an alien spaceship (Jungle - Room #262) and looking at it you find the following message:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Jg ju't dpme up uif upvdi, ju xpslt jo uif hsbogbmmppo!</FONT><BR>
This is a simple substitution (take the preceding letter) which leads to<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#339911">If it's cold to the touch, it works in the granfalloon!</FONT>

<BR><BR><HR>
<H3>Granfalloon</H3>
The granfalloon (City - Floor 3 - Room #331) is composed of a series of vertical sections of dull gold material, attached together horizontally with black cylinders.  In the face of the granfalloon is a wide slot, and a strange dish-shaped device seems to focus at a spot on the floor right in front of the device.<BR>
Given the advice of the alien spaceship, the following cold items work in the granfalloon:<BR>
<A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#mongoo">mongoo</A> -> creates a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#ravus">ravus</A><BR>
<A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#gongo">gongo</A> -> creates a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#flingle">flingle</A><BR>
<A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#torrel">torrel</A> -> creates a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#greeb">greeb</A>

<BR><BR><HR>
<H3>Ribbenfratz</H3>
The ribbenfratz (City - Floor 3 - Room #333) is basically a movie projection system.  There is a slot here in which you can put items.  Following the advice of the voices (see Room #303) we can use the products of the granfalloon in the ribbenfratz.<BR>

<A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#ravus">ravus</A> shows how to make a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#greeb">greeb</A><BR>
<A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#flingle">flingle</A> shows a tour of the jungle, including:
<OL>
<LI>Ancient burial mound of Gastrointestinal Flingducks [shallow hill]</LI>
<LI>Battle of Oddlewokkus Blub</LI>
<LI>[far NE] Monoliths - Cemetery of the Ones From Beyond.
    <BR>Oolgorb knows what mysteries are revealed in the inscriptions.</LI>
<LI>Shows how to make a <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#ceeveese">ceeveese</A></LI>
</OL>
<A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#greeb">greeb</A> shows a movie about <A HREF="fazuul_item_list.html#scroom">scroom</A><BR>
Aliens are arguing over a nebbish, and they treat the scroom as a gun (...blowing cooly across the muzzle of his unholstered scroom...)

<BR><BR><HR>
<H3>Hieroglyphics & Plaques</H3>
If you look at the Hieroglyphics located on the southern wall of the city (Jungle - Room #7) you will see textual clues to three very different graphics.  It seems to indicate a phrase, almost like a rebus, but I haven't figured it totally out yet.<BR>
<OL>
<LI>First, a circle with rectangular bars extending outward from it on the top and bottom with two little lines inside of it forming an angle<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#339911">Seems to me it looks like a 'watch' (could also indicate 'time')</FONT></LI>
<LI>Then a set of four arrows all pointing inward toward a central point</LI>
<LI>Then a large black area with tiny white dots in it here and there.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#339911">Seems to indicate 'stars' or 'space'</FONT></LI>
</OL>
Could the answer be some silly advertisement like <FONT COLOR="#339911">"Watch This Space"</FONT>?
<BR><BR>
The Plaque located on the northern wall of the city (Jungle - Room #24) says <FONT COLOR="#DD0000">BQZBJ Z EKTMFNNM NODM!</FONT>  This is another simple substituion.  Pick the letter that comes after to decode it to:  <FONT COLOR="#339911">CRACK A FLUNGOON OPEN!</FONT>

<BR><BR><HR>
<H3>Orb That Talks</H3>
If you touch the Orb That Talks (Jungle - Room #193) it will recite the following poetry:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#DD0000">A thousand years I've waited<BR>
I'll wait a thousand more<BR>
Rebozo's sweet caress, you know<BR>
Is power, to the core.</FONT>
<BR><BR>
Sadly, I have no idea what this means.  Is a Rebozo an object we can get?  Is a code for a known object?  Will it work as a power source to other machinery?
