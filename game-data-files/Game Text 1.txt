Thinking of taking a vacation?
Well, you were, and then something happened.  As a seasoned intergalactic
traveler, you are accustomed to the occasional hyperspace grid interlock,
or matter-transmitter hiccup.
But this is something else entirely!  You were just beaming down to FAZUUL,
playground pleasure planet of the galactic elite, when all of a sudden
the vortex cannonballed, the goonplasm deflated, and the freplishers skrank
out.  You are left standing on the tarmac in front of a large, deserted
alien city.
The welcoming committee is absent.  The vacationland spa hosts and
hostesses have all mysteriously disappeared.  You have reached FAZUUL,
all right, but your vacation is over, and your nightmare has just begun.

As you gaze around in dismay, you may be wondering "What in the Nine
Moons of Jupiter is this??".  This is a multi-user online adventure game.
It is something along the lines of Zork, Deadline, and so on, but with a
key difference: many people can play at once, and they are all in the
SAME simulated universe.  The program that generates this universe is
like an automated dungeon master in "Dungeons and Dragons"... one that
plays no favorites, makes no mistakes, and has the capacity to track a
large number of individuals or groups completely independently of one
another.
FAZUUL was originally a harsh, forbidding world of intense dry heat and
endless rolling sand dunes.  It had been inhabited, millions of years
earlier, by a strange alien civilization of which little is known.  The
aliens all died out long ago of mysterious biological causes, leaving
their technology behind.
Then humans came along, and, through the miracles of kwish-age
engineering, FAZUUL was transformed into a beautiful leisure paradise,
fully equipped with all the essentials of the up-to-date resort planet.

Due to a quantum fluctuation of the void, however, the entire tourist
mass transit system on FAZUUL has been incapacitated.  Vacationers can
beam in but they can't beam back out!
Or can they?  As a marooned vacationer on this paradise planet, you and
your fellow marooned vacationers may be able to figure out the alien
technology lying around, pool your resources and knowledge, and find a
way to escape.
Or, if you like, you can spend your time playing the various Galactic
games that have been installed as part of the resort's facilities, such
as Foon-Ball and Umflungoo.  Or, you may just explore around, talk with
other players, fight with them, whatever you like!
When you see the ">" prompt, feel free to enter commands to your player
to move around (North, South, East, or West), pick up objects that you
see, talk to the other marooned vacationers in your vicinity (with the
"say" command), and so on.  Your terminal will be your eyes and ears,
and will take whatever actions you tell it to (within reason) in your
name.  Type "help" at any time if you need help.

You suddenly feel the touch of a gentle breeze for a moment!

Help is available on the following subjects:
  FAZUUL      (background info on FAZUUL)
  talking     (how to talk, shout, etc.)
  moving      (how to move around)
  trading     (how to trade things with other players)
  quitting    (how to exit from FAZUUL)
  strategy    (a few hints)
To obtain help on any of these subjects, type "help <subject>".
For example, to learn how to move around, type "help moving".
[0;1;32m...
You have arrived on FAZUUL, a lush pleasure planet discovered years ago
by a number of shipwrecked space captains.  At the time of its
discovery, FAZUUL was a harsh, forbidding world of intense dry heat and
endless rolling sand dunes.  Now, however, through the miracles of
kwish-age engineering, FAZUUL has been transformed into a beautiful
leisure paradise, fully equipped with all of the essentials of the
up-to-date resort planet.
Due to a quantum fluctuation of the void, however, the entire tourist
mass transit system on FAZUUL has been incapacitated.  Vacationers can
beam in but they can't beam back out!
Or can they?  As a marooned vacationer on this paradise planet, you and
your fellow marooned vacationers may be able to figure out the alien
technology lying around, pool your resources and knowledge, and find a
way to escape.  Or, if you like, you can spend your time playing the
various Galactic games that have been installed as part of the resort's
facilities, such as Foon-Ball and Umflungoo.  Or, you are free to just
explore around, talk with other players, fight with them, or whatever
you like!
Type "help strategy" for some strategy hints...
[0;1;32m...
You can talk to other players in your immediate vicinity by typing the
word "say", followed by whatever it is you want to say to them.  If you
want your voice to carry further, use "shout" or "yell".  Everyone
within hearing distance will hear you.
If you want to communicate privately with another player in your
immediate area, you can type "whisper to <so-and-so>", followed by your
confidential message -- other players nearby will only know that you
have whispered something, not what it is you whispered.
[0;1;32m...
You move around by telling FAZUUL the direction in which you want to
move: north, south, east, or west.  Sometimes, depending on the
situation, other moves will also make sense.  FAZUUL keeps track of the
last five places you have visited, and gives you the full description of
the place only if it is not one of these last five.  You may tell FAZUUL
to always give you short place-descriptions by typing "brief" (this may
be undone by typing "nonbrief").
[0;1;32m...
You can trade crackers, goods, services, and information with other
players any time you like, in any way you like.  Typing "give
<such-and-such> to <so-and-so>" will cause the item to be transferred to
the player you specify, assuming that (a) you possessed it in the first
place, and (b) the specified player is in your immediate area.  The item
can be either a device you are holding, or a count of crackers (for
example, "GIVE 5 CRACKERS TO BEELZEBUB").  The terms and conditions of
any sale are entirely yours to work out with your co-conspirator.
[0;1;32m...
The original inhabitants of FAZUUL all perished thousands of years ago of
biological causes, leaving behind odd bits and pieces of incredibly
advanced technology.  The technology takes the form of the various
objects with strange names that you find lying around here and there.
Since they are based on advanced alien technology, their various purposes
may not be apparent to you at first, but by experimenting around with
them you may find that some of them have amazing properties.
You can also assemble the objects together in various ways to make more
complex and interesting devices (e.g. "ATTACH THE GWINGUS TO THE
MONGOO").  These combined devices can then be further combined, and so
on.  A major portion of the information you will be trading with other
players relates to which devices combine with which others, what they do
when combined, how you activate them, the side effects they might have,
and so on.
[0;1;32m...
To quit FAZUUL, type "exit", or just "x".  Your player will be placed
into "hypospatial stasis," which means that you will vanish from the
FAZUUL universe but that your complete status will be saved, awaiting
your return to the game.  Any objects you are holding go into hypospatial
stasis with you, so that you can pick up playing again right where you
left off.
If you are lost in the jungle or something and merely wish to restart
the game afresh, type "restart" for further information.
[0;1;32m...You're standing just outside a wide gate leading north into an exotic alien
city glittering brightly in the bluish-white sunlight.  To the south, east, and west of
you, a dense forest obstructs your view.
[0;1;32m...You're standing on the tarmac of a large spaceport, under the glare of a
bluish-white sun.  To the west you see a large gate leading into an exotic alien city,
with glittering towers stretching up into the sky.  To the north, south, and east, a
shimmering bluish force field appears to block your path.  Through the force field, you
can see the outlines of the lush forest which appears to border the spaceport in every
direction except west.
[0;1;32m...You're standing just outside a wide gate leading south into a strange alien
city glittering brightly in the bluish-white sunlight.  To the north, east, and west of
you, a dense forest obstructs your view.
[0;1;32m...You're standing just outside a wide, ornate gateway leading east into an
intricate alien city glittering brightly in the bluish-white sunlight.  To the north,
south, and west of you, a dense forest obstructs your view.
[0;1;32m...You're standing at the edge of a dense jungle.  A tall wall to your north
blocks your way in that direction, but a narrow footpath hugs the wall as far as you can
see (which isn't very far) to the east and west.  To the south, you can see pale bluish
sunlight filtering through the foliage of the dark, unbroken forest.
[0;1;32m...You're standing at the edge of a dense jungle.  A tall wall to your west blocks

[0;1;32m...You're standing beside what seems to be the outside southwest corner of a
large, walled-in area, with the strange, fertile smells of the jungle wafting about your
nostrils.  The footpath stretches away into the distance to the north and east, but only
unbroken jungle confronts you on the west and south.
[0;1;32m...You have reached what appears to be the outside southeast corner of a large,
walled-in area.  The eerie sounds of the primeval jungle surround you to the east and
south, but the footpath can be seen hugging the walls to the north and west.
[0;1;32m...You're standing beside what seems to be the outside northeast corner of a
large, walled-in area, with the strange, fertile smells of the jungle wafting about your
nostrils.  The footpath stretches away into the distance to the south and west, but only
unbroken jungle confronts you on the east and north.
[0;1;32m...You have reached what appears to be the outside northwest corner of a large,
walled-in area.  The eerie sounds of the primeval jungle surround you to the west and
north, but the footpath can be seen hugging the walls to the south and east.
[0;1;32m...The damp, heady fragrance of the jungle makes you dizzy, and you seem to hear
an eerie, lost voice through the whistling of the wind, saying: "rrreeetuuurn to the
city, before all is losss-sst... many a novice has ventured faaa-ar into the jungle,
never to return...".  Dimly through the flickering leaves, you sense the city in the
distance to the southeast.

never to return...".  Dimly through the flickering leaves, you sense the city in the
distance to the south.
[0;1;32m...You're in the middle of a dense tropical forest.  Overhead, the jungle canopy
filters out all but a few flickering rays of blue sunlight, and the jungle surrounds you
to the north, south, east, and west as far as the eye can see.
[0;1;32m...You've reached a small hillock in the dense underbrush.  Through a break in the
foliage, a city appears in the distance to the northeast.
[0;1;32m...You've reached a small hillock in the dense underbrush.  Through a break in the

[0;1;32m...You've reached a small hillock in the dense underbrush.  Through a break in the
foliage, a city appears in the distance to the west.
[0;1;32m...You've climbed a sizable hill, hidden in the forest.  Far away to the west,
through the shimmering leaves, a glittering point of light catches your attention... can
it be the city?
[0;1;32m...You've climbed to the top of a high mesa whose sides have been worn down over
the years by weathering action.  Far, far to the west you detect a faint shimmer of
light shifting position as the hot jungle air swishes around.  It might be just a
mirage, or it might be... the city!
[0;1;32m...You're standing at the edge of a dense jungle.  A tall wall to your north
blocks your way in that direction, but a narrow footpath hugs the wall as far as you can
see (which isn't very far) to the east and west.  To the south, you can see pale bluish
sunlight filtering through the foliage of the dark, unbroken forest.  You notice some
strange hieroglyphics carved into the wall just above eye level here.
[0;1;32m...You're standing at the edge of a dense jungle.  A tall wall to your south
blocks your way in that direction, but a narrow footpath hugs the wall as far as you can
see (which isn't very far) to the east and west.  To the north, you can see pale bluish
sunlight filtering through the foliage of the dark, unbroken forest.  You notice a
metallic plaque of some kind built into the face of the wall just above eye level.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  There is a strange
hulk of metal several feet across lying half-buried in the underbrush here, which
appears to be the remains of a defunct alien spaceship!
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  You come upon a
strange stubby green cylinder, a foot or two in diameter, poking up out of the
underbrush.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  You feel a strange
chill in the air here.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  A shiny hemisphere
of metal is sitting in the underbrush a few feet away.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  A large freenish is
stationed here in a little clearing, its gold sides gleaming in the sun.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  You have come upon
a strange gray monolith jutting up out of the underbrush at a sharp angle.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  You seem to have
stumbled across a giant mongooosk embedded in the dirt, with its triple sweenars
undulating slowly in the forest breeze.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  Almost hidden
beneath a layer of leaves and moss there is a rectangular metal platform, several feet
wide, with a white X inscribed in its center.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  You notice a large,
oddly-shaped rock jutting out of the underbrush a few feet away.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  There is a strange
hulk of metal several feet across lying half-buried in the dirt here, which appears to
be the remains of a defunct alien spaceship!
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a small clearing in the jungle.  The rain has lightened up a
little, and has settled down to a steady drizzle.  There, at the exact geometric center
of the clearing, is a giant oddlewokkus!
[0;1;32m...You have entered a sheltered little nook of the forest, where the rain does not
seem to get through.  The singing of the insects and the whistling of the wind seems
more relaxing here somehow.  You notice something glittering out of the corner of your
eye, which upon investigation turns out to be a blub, hanging suspended in space a foot
or so off the ground.
[0;1;32m...The rain has stopped.  You're standing in a strangely bare section of the
forest, and you feel an odd sense of foreboding here, for directly at the center of the
bare area is a huge glowing nofzinger!
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  Sitting right out
in plain sight is a large statue of an alien, in repose.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  Before you is a
large statue of an alien!
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  A large statue of
an alien sitting in what appears to be a contemplative mood stands before you.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  You have come upon
a large statue of an alien sitting half-covered by the foliage.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  You have come upon
a strange gray monolith covered with vines, jutting up out of the earth at a sharp
angle.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  A short distance
away you see a large, pale white orb standing on a dark square pedestal, with a number
of tangled vines growing about its base.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  You have come upon
a strange gray monolith covered with vines, jutting up out of the earth at a sharp

[0;1;32m...You're in the midst of a massive thunderstorm!  The wind whips the rain into
your eyes, making it difficult to see more than ten feet in any direction.
[0;1;32m ...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  To the west, the
clouds seem very dark, and you can hear the sound of rain hitting the treetops, although
it is dry where you are.
[0;1;32m ...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  To the north, the
clouds seem very dark, and you can hear the sound of rain hitting the treetops, although
it is dry where you are.
[0;1;32m ...You're surrounded by dense green jungle in all directions.  To the south, the
clouds seem very dark, and you can hear the sound of rain hitting the treetops, although
it is dry where you are.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in what appears to be a reception area, with a large desk
stretching almost all the way across the room.  The desk appears to have some writing on
it.  To the south is a gate leading to the jungle.  Faintly luminescent portals lead to
the north and east.
[0;1;32m...You're standing on a broad outdoor walkway running east and west, with tall
crystalline towers rising up on either side.  To the east is a gate leading to the
spaceport.  Further on down the walkway to the west is a giant glowing sphere on a
pedestal, and to the south is an open portal leading into the base of one of the
crystalline towers.
[0;1;32m...You're standing on a broad covered walkway running north and south between the
gate to the jungle to the north and a strange small building to the south.  The words
"OSMOTIC AVAILABLE" appear to be floating in space just above the entrance to the
building.  Also, there is a crooked little pathway leading off to the west.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in what seems to have once been a reception area of some sort,
with a large, wide desk in the middle of the room.  To the west is the west gate of the
city, and portals from the room lead away to the east and south.
[0;1;32m...You're in a strange room where the walls scintillate in blue and green, as
though they were made of millions of little lights.  Portals lead to the west and
north.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a short corridor running north and south.  There is an odd
hexagonal slot in the west wall with signs of wear around its edges.
[0;1;32m...You're in the Hall of Umflungoo, an auditorium-sized room with Umflungoo
banners hanging from the rafters.  There is a large circular hole in the middle of the
floor; portals lead out of the hall to the north and south.  A small panel attached to
the wall near the north portal appears to have some writing on it.
[0;1;32m...You're in a wide hallway making a dogleg to the west while running north and
south.  There seems to be a lot of dirt on the floor here, as though it were being
tracked in from somewhere.  Faintly luminescent portals appear to lead to the north,
south, and west.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a small cubicle with a very dirty floor.  You can feel the
floor vibrate as you stand here.  Oval-shaped portals lead to the east and north.
[0;1;32m...You have entered a large circular chamber with exits leading in all directions.
On the wall is a faded diagram of some kind... it looks at first glance as though it
might be a map.
[0;1;32m...You're walking down a long hall with portals leading to the north, south, and
east.  All along the hall are some sort of transparent display cases with weird
substances inside them.  There seems to be a lot of dirt on the floor here, as though it
were being tracked in from someplace nearby.
[0;1;32m...You're standing beside a giant glowing sphere set in the middle of a walkway.
To the north is a small gate leading to a little courtyard, and to the west is an
entryway leading into a large circular building with sparkling metallic blue walls.  The
walkway you are standing on stretches off to a gate in the distance to the east.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a small courtyard with exotic towers rising to the sky all
around you.  One pathway leads to a gate to the south, and another leads to an entrance
in one of the towers to the west.
[0;1;32m...You have entered the Foon-Ball Emporium.  Overhead you can see the usual
holographically-shaded regions of pleebor, fong, oomwazzitz, and so on, in the standard
figure-eight pattern.  A set of instructions appears on the wall, just above a slot
about the size of a gwingus.  Portals lead from the Emporium in all directions.
[0;1;32m...You're inside the strange little building, which only appears to have one room.
Sniffing the air, you smell ozone quite strongly, but the smell does not seem to come
from anywhere in particular.  A large osmotic is hovering in the center of the room!
The only exit seems to be to the north.
[0;1;32m...You're walking down a glowing pathway through what was at one time apparently a
garden of some kind.  To the south there is a large iridescent building with an entrance
at its base.  To the east, the pathway opens out onto a broad covered walkway running
north and south.  To the west is a cluster of small dome-shaped structures, and to the
north is a tall narrow building, all black, topped by a giant silver disk.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a large square chamber with both walls and floor completely
jet black.  Looking up, you cannot see the ceiling.  Brightly glowing portals lead west
and south.
[0;1;32m...You're inside a strange little dome-shaped structure.  The inside surface of
the dome is covered with millions of tiny lights that seem to blink on and off in many
different colors, at random.  There is a strange discolored area on the floor, with the
beginnings of a lip forming around it.  Portals lead to the east and north.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in the middle of a large hall filled with little gusts of wind.
As the gusts whistle around you, they almost sound like voices at the edge of hearing.
A large dark portal leads away to the east, and another smaller one leads south.
[0;1;32m...You have entered a low short corridor.  At the west end, a sort of shimmering
curtain seems to form, through which you can barely see the outlines of a room beyond.
To the east, the corridor opens out into a larger room.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a large room with a clean-swept floor.  A strange smell
fills the air, as though some solvent has been used here recently in cleaning up.
Portals lead to the west and south, and to the east is a large rectangular opening in
the wall.
[0;1;32m...You find yourself in a low circular chamber with a strange sort of wheel-shaped
object on a pedestal in the middle.  Faintly luminescent portals lead to the north and
east.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a strange rectangular chamber with chromed metallic walls.
In the middle of the room sits a giant grinfrazzitz!  Rectangular openings in the walls
lead west and south.
[0;1;32m...You're in a room filled with tables of an odd design, as though this might have
been a gathering place for the aliens at one time.  Portals lead away to the east and
west, and to the north there is a large rectangular opening in the wall.
[0;1;32m...You're in a long curved corridor with exits to the west and south.  Strange
staccato sounds appear to be coming from the southern end of the corridor.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by sparks!  Great flashes of light shoot out of the walls all
around you, singeing the ends of your hair and half blinding you!  Dimly through the
sparks you sense an exit to the east.
[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by sparks!  Great flashes of light shoot out of the walls all

[0;1;32m...You're surrounded by sparks!  Great flashes of light shoot out of the walls all
around you, singeing the ends of your hair and half blinding you!  Dimly through the
sparks you sense an exit to the west.
[0;1;32m...You're standing on a luminescent platform pulsing slowly in a beautiful gold
color.  Brilliant blue force fields appear to bar your way except to the east, where you
can see a softly carpeted area beckoning.
[0;1;32m...You're standing ankle-deep in the carpet.  Soft, ethereal music drifts through
the air to your ears.  A ramp leads up through a small portal to the east, and a
passageway appears to lead south as well.  To the west is the golden glowing platform.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in some sort of observation chamber looking out into a star
field of unparalleled beauty.  Galactic communication is taking place before your very
eyes!  A ramp leads downward to your west.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in front of the entrance to a brightly lit room.  A red sign
over the doorway blinks at you: METASTATIC CONTROL CHAMBER, AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.
The doorway leads south.  Another doorway leads east to a room filled with machinery,
and the passageway to the north leads back to the softly carpeted area.
[0;1;32m...You're in a large room packed full of strange and intricate machinery.  A long
tube seems to run the length of the room from south to north, terminating on the north
end in a wall, and on the south end opening out into a bare chrome-walled cubicle.  It
appears possible to crawl out of the machinery to either the west or the south.
[0;1;32m...You're in the metastatic transfer chamber, a small bare cubicle with smooth chrome floor, walls,
and ceiling.  To the north is a mass of machinery with a narrow crawl-space leading deep
into it, and to the west is the metastatic control chamber.
[0;1;32m...You're in a small room with portals leading east and south.  There is a hopper
here with a thick hose leading out the bottom of it into the wall.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a gold-walled chamber in front of a console of some sort
with two lights on it and a single pushbutton marked "S".  Both of the lights are off.
Faintly glowing portals lead west and south.
[0;1;32m...You're in a small bare room with what appears to be a set of five buttons on
the wall: one red, one blue, one yellow, one purple, and one green.  Portals lead to the
west and north.
[0;1;32m...You're in a long chamber with five colored globes up near the ceiling.  Sparks
fly between the globes from time to time.  Portals lead east, west, and north.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in front of a metallic gold desk at the entrance to what is
apparently a laboratory of some sort.  Strange electrical discharges light up the room
to your east from time to time.  A long corridor stretches away to your north.
[0;1;32m...You're walking down a long north-south corridor.  In the distance to the south
you can see a glimmer of light reflecting off of something metallic.
[0;1;32m...You're walking down a long corridor leading north and south.
[0;1;32m...You're walking down a long corridor leading north and south.
[0;1;32m...You're walking down a long corridor leading north and south.  In the distance
to the north you can make out a gyrating light pattern of some kind.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a sort of foyer.  A wildly gyrating pattern of light in the
middle of the floor makes it hard to concentrate.  Portals lead to the north and east,
and a corridor stretches away to the south.
[0;1;32m...You're in a large room vaguely resembling a lobby, with portals leading off to
the north and west.  In the east wall there is a peculiar hexagonal slot, with signs of
wear around its edges.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a small carpeted room with portals leading to the east and
south.  Almost half the space in the room is taken up by a large granfalloon, which sits
there humming expectantly.
[0;1;32m...You have entered a large hall filled with benches facing north.  The north wall
of the hall seems to be covered with a sort of thin mist.  There is a smell of incense
in the air.  Portals lead east, west, and south from here.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a small side-chamber of the large hall.  On the north wall
of the chamber is a giant ribbenfratz.  The only exit appears to be the portal you came
in through, to the west.
[0;1;32m...You're weightless, floating in a space that takes no space, with a greyish-blue
mist all around you, stretching to infinity in every direction.  A faint susurrus of
sound surrounds you, seeming to draw energy from you, making your whole body glow with a
kind of creative energy.  You feel a strange sense of power coursing through you, as
though you have the power here to create anything, anything at all.
[0;1;32m...You're in a low-slung east-west passageway that terminates in a blank wall to
the west.  The floor here is encrusted with dirt.
[0;1;32m...You have entered a vast dark hall with a hard stone floor.  It is so dark that you
cannot see any of the exits.  There appears to be a switch of some sort on the wall
nearby.
[0;1;32m...You are in a small dirt-floored room filled with weird translucent floating
globules.  The globules seem to be attracted to you, and they begin to cluster around
you.  Dimly glowing portals lead north and west.
[0;1;32m...You're in a small chamber brightly lit by a strange light source in the
ceiling.  The light is of a type you've never seen before, an odd, indefinable color.
Portals stand open to the west and south.
[0;1;32m...You're in a short passageway leading north and south, with a branch to the east
in the middle.
[0;1;32m...You're in a long north-south passageway with a dirt floor.  To the north the
passageway appears to open out into a brightly lit area, but to the south the passageway
ends in a featureless wall.
[0;1;32m...You're standing on a wide observation deck overlooking an area containing giant
coils of some crystalline material.  A doorway leads from the deck to the north, and a
low passageway leads off to the south.  A short ramp leads east from the deck to the
area with the coils.
[0;1;32m...You're standing beside a series of giant coils made of some bizarre crystalline
material.  To the west is a sort of observation deck, and portals also lead away to the
north and east.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a room with a large hopper built into the floor.  Faintly
luminescent portals lead to the north, south, and west.
[0;1;32m...You're in a large room with several pieces of furniture closely resembling
desks, as though this had been an alien office of some kind.  Portals lead away to the
west, south, and north.
[0;1;32m...You're in a small control room of some sort containing a number of odd-looking
instruments.  The only instrument even remotely recognizable is a small console with a
light on it and a switch with the word START scratched into the metal beside it.  The
light does not appear to be lit.  Portals lead to the north, south, and east.
[0;1;32m...You're in a long hallway running east and west with a portal to the south at
the west end, and a portal to the east at the east end.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a small room with portals leading from it in all directions.
A strange pattern of sparkling colors spins and dances about on the ceiling overhead.
[0;1;32m...You're walking along an east-west hallway with doorways leading to the north
and south spaced along it.  The hallway terminates in a blank wall to the east, but a
portal to the west here appears to be open.
[0;1;32m...You're in a small room with what appears to be a metal box set into one wall.
A misty sort of substance seems to pour into the room from the portal to the west, but
the mist dissipates as it enters.  A second portal leads south.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in the midst of a sparkling white mist so thick that you cannot
see the walls of the room.
[0;1;32m...You find yourself in a weird little egg-shaped chamber whose walls seem to
pulsate in various shades of purple.  At about waist level there is a slot in the wall
about the size of your fist.  The one portal to the chamber leads south.
[0;1;32m...If this message appears, it is bug number 352!  Please notify the System
Operator immediately!
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a short corridor running north and south.  There is an open
portal in the west wall leading to an odd little egg-shaped chamber.
[0;1;32m...You're in a large room vaguely resembling a lobby, with portals leading off to
the north and west.  In the east wall there is an open portal to an odd little

[0;1;32m...You're standing in a strange rectangular chamber with solid chromed metallic
walls on all sides.  In the middle of the room sits a giant grinfrazzitz!
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a large room with a clean-swept floor.  A strange smell
fills the air, as though some solvent has been used here recently in cleaning
up.  A great heavy panel lies against the wall to the east, and portals lead
to the west and south.
[0;1;32m...You're in a room filled with tables of an odd design, as though this might have
been a gathering place for the aliens at one time.  A great heavy panel lies against the
wall to the north, and portals lead away to the east and west.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a gold-walled chamber in front of a console of some sort
with two lights on it and a single pushbutton marked "S".  Both of the lights are
flashing madly, and a loud high-pitched beeping sound is coming from the console.
Faintly glowing portals lead west and south.
[0;1;32m...You're in a small room with portals leading east and south.  There is a hopper
here with a thick hose leading out the bottom of it into the wall.  A beeping noise is
coming from the room to your east.

glowing steadily, and the air around the console seems charged with energy...  Faintly
glowing portals lead west and south.
[0;1;32m...You're in a long chamber with a blue globe extending down from the ceiling on a
long crystalline rod.  The globe appears to be swirling with some sort of strange gas.
Four other globes of various colors remain up near the ceiling, with sparks flying
between them from time to time.  Portals lead east, west, and north.
[0;1;32m...You're in a long chamber with a blue globe and a green globe extending down
from the ceiling on long crystalline rods.  The globes appear to be swirling with some
sort of strange gas.  Three other globes of various colors remain up near the ceiling,
with sparks flying between them from time to time.  Portals lead east, west, and north.
[0;1;32m...You're in a long chamber with three globes extending down from the ceiling on
long crystalline rods, one blue, one green, and one purple.  The globes appear to be
swirling with some sort of strange gas.  A red globe and a yellow globe remain up near
the ceiling, with with sparks flying between them from time to time.  Portals lead east,
west, and north.

[0;1;32m...You're in a long chamber with a five globes of various colors extending down
from the ceiling on long crystalline rods.  The globes make a whooshing sound as the gas
in them swirls violently.  Portals lead east, west, and north.
[0;1;32m...You are in a vast hall with a hard stone floor.  Filling the center of the room
is a huge, intricate machine of some sort, with a pale orange corona surrounding it.  A
chute, leading into the machine, is off to one side.  Portals lead away to the north, east,
and west.
[0;1;32m...You're inside a strange little dome-shaped structure.  The inside surface of
the dome is covered with millions of tiny lights, many of which are glowing green, while
the rest change color at random.  Portals lead to the east and north.
[0;1;32m...You're inside a strange little dome-shaped structure.  The inside surface of
the dome is covered with millions of tiny lights, all of which are now glowing green!
Portals lead to the east and north.
[0;1;32m...You're standing beside a series of giant coils made of some bizarre crystalline
material.  The coils are glowing brightly and making a deep, powerful humming sound.  To
the west is a sort of observation deck, and portals also lead away to the north and
east.
[0;1;32m...You're standing in a room with a large hopper built into the floor.  Faintly
luminescent portals lead to the north, south, and west.  A deep, powerful humming sound
is coming from the portal to the west.
[0;1;32m...You're standing on a wide observation deck overlooking an area containing giant
coils of some crystalline material.  The coils appear to be glowing and putting out a
deep, powerful humming sound.  A doorway leads from the deck to the north, and a low
passageway leads off to the south.  A short ramp leads east from the deck to the area
with the coils.
[0;1;32m...You're in a small control room of some sort containing a number of odd-looking
instruments.  The only instrument even remotely recognizable is a small console with a
light on it and a switch with the word START scratched into the metal beside it.  The
light does not appear to be lit.  A deep, powerful humming sound is coming through the
portal to the south.  Other portals lead east and north.

[0;1;32m...You're in a small control room of some sort containing a number of odd-looking
instruments.  The only instrument even remotely recognizable is a small console with a
light on it and a switch with the word START scratched into the metal beside it.  The
light is blinking on and off madly in a green color.  The very air here seems to be
charged with energy, and a great, vibrant humming sound is coming from the portal to the
south.  Other portals lead east and north.
[0;1;32m...You're in a wide hallway making a dogleg to the west while running north and
south.  There seems to be a lot of dirt on the floor here, as though it were being
tracked in from somewhere.  Faintly luminescent portals appear to lead to the north and
south.
[0;1;32m...You're walking down a long hall with portals leading to the north and east.
All along the hall are some sort of transparent display cases with weird substances
inside them.  There seems to be a lot of dirt on the floor here, as though it were being
tracked in from someplace nearby.
[0;1;32m...You're in a low-slung east-west passageway with portals at the east and west
ends.  The floor here is encrusted with dirt.
[0;1;32m...You're in a long north-south passageway with a dirt floor.  To the north the
passageway appears to open out into a brightly lit area, and a faintly luminescent
portal leads south.
[0;1;32m...You're inside the strange little building.  An almost overpowering smell of
ozone fills the air, and there is a large osmotic hovering in the center of the room.  A
large rectangular opening in the east wall leads to a short corridor, and a portal in
the north wall leads outside.
[0;1;32m...You have entered a low short corridor running east and west.  You catch a whiff
of ozone from time to time here.
[0;1;32m...The fluid has a mildly tart flavor, and as it slides down your throat it
seems to feel as though it is penetrating throughout your body in the process.
You feel a slight sense of lightheadedness, but this quickly passes.
[0;1;32m***
You hear a sudden gurgling sound!
***
A pale blue fluid has just started gushing out of one of the tubes on
the freenish!
[0;1;32m***
The flow of pale blue fluid out of the freenish has just stopped all of
a sudden!
[0;1;32m
...Your field of view is suddenly filled with a vision of a spaceport
city... huge starships appear lined up in berths extending far into the
distance to the east, and the air is filled with flying craft of every
possible sort and description.  All at once a small craft approaches you
at a steep angle and lands next to you on the platform.  The side of the
craft abruptly parts, and a five-tentacled alien climbs out and
undulates away toward the city.  Looking inside the ship for the
controls, you notice that it seems to have none, but there is a set of
tables inscribed into one wall.  You notice that the tables seem to
consist of numbers, inscribed in groups of four, three groups per line
in each case followed by some cryptic cuneiform writing.  As you lean
forward to examine the tables more closely, you feel yourself losing
your balance, and falling... falling... falling... and then the vision
has passed and you find that you have fallen off the platform.
[0;1;32m***
You suddenly hear a low, ponderous voice issuing from the statue:
     Three of one and two of three
     For those who would know fame
     Coordinates be known to thee
     Both they are the same.
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly a low, droning noise starts up and soon you are able to
make sense of it... a chanting voice is coming from the statue:
     Two of three and one of two
     Made the ancients run
     Abercrombie, Fitch, and You:
     Differenced, they are one.
[0;1;32m***
The statue beside you suddenly starts making a low grinding noise!
Then, in a low but almost hesitant tone, as though after centuries
of silence, a voice from the statue says:
     One of two and three of one
     Form a golden tree...
     Harken to the Oddlewokkus:
     Added, they are three.
[0;1;32m***
You hear a booming low voice suddenly issuing from the statue:
     Two the same and one is different
     Known, is almost done.
     Digitally, digitalis
     Lower one is one.

[0;1;32m...The button clicks into place!
[0;1;32m***
As the button is pressed, you hear a low, loud, grinding whistle, and
sparks fly across the face of the panel.  A concealed fixture above the
transfer chamber entrance blinks out OVERLOAD...OVERLOAD...OVERLOAD.
A gout of smoke suddenly shoots from beneath the panel faceplate.
[0;1;32m***
You hear a low, loud grinding whistle all of a sudden, and the control
room to the west is filled with light and sparks!  Then the control room
fills up with smoke, but you do not feel anything.
[0;1;32m***
YOU'RE SUDDENLY GONE!

YOU'RE BEING SHOT THROUGH TUBES, WHIPPED AROUND, HERE, THERE, AND THE
OTHER PLACE!

YOU'RE BLOWN THROUGH SPACE WARPS, TIME DOMAINS, SUBSPACE VORTEXES,
INTERQUANTUMHYPERMETAMOLECULAR UPS AND DOWNS, BACKS AND FORTHS!
***
You're suddenly in the nexus of the Central Intergalactic Switching
Network, and a voice boooms into your skull:
ENTER YOUR DESTINATION COORDINATES: 
[0;1;32m***
The metastatic transfer chamber to the east suddenly flashes bright white, and the image of the
person standing there seems to sparkle and disintegrate into a scintillating
wisp of gas... and then,
            t h e y ' r e    g o n e !
[0;1;32m...The button clicks into place!
[0;1;32m***
You suddenly see a bright flash of light and there is a wrenching
sensation as though your component molecules are being disassembled
and sent one at a time through the galactic switching network...
and then, you feel yourself being re-assembled in a space away from
space, and a time away from time...
...And it begins to slowly dawn upon you that... you have won.
YYYYYY
YYYYYY
AAAAAA
AAAAAA
HHHHHH         Your name has been logged to the system Audit Trail

[0;1;32m***
THE VOICE BOOMS IN YOUR EARS:
THOSE ARE ILLEGAL COORDINATES
          ILLEGAL COORDINATES
          ILLEGAL COORDINATES
Your vision is suddenly obscured by a scintillating cloud of white mist!
You feel a whirling, swirling motion, as though you are caught in a
subspace vortex, and all of the objects you are carrying are ripped from
your grasp!  Then the motion slowly subsides and your vision clears...
[0;1;32m...The button seems to glow red hot as you press it down!
[0;1;32m***
The two lights start flashing madly on and off as a wild beeping starts
emanating from beneath the console!
[0;1;32m***
You hear a mad beeping sound start up in the room to the east!
[0;1;32m***
You hear a mad beeping sound start up in the room to the north!
[0;1;32m...It won't move -- it seems to be locked in place.
[0;1;32m***
The beeping just stopped, and the lights stopped flashing!
[0;1;32m***
The beeping sound coming from the room to the east just stopped!
[0;1;32m***
The beeping sound coming from the room to the north just stopped!

[0;1;32m***
The light on the left-hand side of the console just went out!
[0;1;32m...It lit up just as you did that!
[0;1;32m***
You hear a whirring noise coming from the portal to the west!
[0;1;32m...Where do you see a button like that?
[0;1;32m***
The blue globe suddenly comes down from the ceiling on a long rod made
of some sort of crystalline material, making a whirring noise.
[0;1;32m***
The green globe suddenly comes down from the ceiling on a long rod made
of some sort of crystalline material, making a whirring noise.

[0;1;32m***
All of the globes suddenly retract back up to the ceiling with a flurry
of whirring noises!
[0;1;32m***
The light on the right-hand side of the panel just lit up!
[0;1;32m***
The light on the right-hand side of the panel just went out!
[0;1;32m***
The lights in the hall are dimming, dimming, going out!  The north wall
seems to glow a little in the darkness...
[0;1;32m***
The room through the portal to your east is suddenly getting darker and
darker!
[0;1;32m***
The room through the portal to your north is suddenly getting darker and
darker!
[0;1;32m***
The room through the portal to your west is suddenly getting darker and
darker!
[0;1;32m***
The wall to your north suddenly clears and lights up to portray a three-
dimensional scene showing hundreds of bizarre alien creatures shuffling
about in some sort of cavernous chamber filled with machinery.  A voice
suddenly seems to come into your head, saying: "Welcome to the
X-gazax-bit tutorial seminar on GREEB assembly... here you see the
factory where our dutiful X-gazax-bit factory workers are busily
assembling the parts you need to make a GREEB of your very own...".
[0;1;32m***
The three-dimensional image in the north wall changes to show a pair
of the bizarre aliens struggling to fit two mysterious devices together,
and you hear the voice in your head again, saying: "Here Frilb and
Zilf, X-gazax-bit's star assembly supervisors, are shown creating a
WONGUM, one of the most hazardous assembly operations known.  That's
Frilb holding the felafel!  Hi, Frilb!".  The image of one of the aliens
looks up, grimaces briefly and waves a tentacle.
[0;1;32m***
The image in the north wall shows the aliens holding up the completed
wongum, as the voice in your head continues: "Remember never to think
about an operational WONGUM unless fully intending to!  Now, here's
Aardvarb" -- a squat, snub-nosed alien trots up -- "with the QUAHOG!
Let's ask Aardvarb what KIND of quahog that is!".  The image zooms in
on what you take to be the creature's face.
[0;1;32m***
The image of Aardvarb on the north wall seems to twist and distort as a
high-pitched voice comes into your head now: "This is the BAGLOON/DONGLE
QUAHOG, Flisk!  None other will do!"  The original voice continues: "Yes!
Now, we attach the WONGUM to the BAGLOON/DONGLE QUAHOG like this" -- the
image shows the aliens grunting and sweating as they jam the two together
-- "and voila!  A shiny new GREEB!  Always come to X-gazax-bit for all of
your GREEB needs!".
[0;1;32m***
The wall to your north suddenly clears and lights up in a three-
dimensional scene showing a panning view of the city you are in, as seen
when it was still surrounded by desert.  A strange, whining voice comes
into your head from some unseen source: "W-welcome to the
F-flakoforeignjive vicarious desert exploration e-experience!".  The view
pans past the city to fill the screen with desert.  "Our intrepid
d-desert explorers show Y-YOU the wonders of the p-prairie without Y-YOU
getting your t-tentacles fried off!"...
[0;1;32m***
The three-dimensional desert scene on the north wall begins to move toward
you as the whining voice continues: "M-many sites of interest appear in
the d-desert!  F-for instance, here is an ancient b-burial mound of the
once-mighty Gastrointestinal Flingducks!".  The image pans over a shallow
hill in the red sands.  "Or here, as we s-see, the s-site of the reknowned
B-battle of the Oddlewokkus Blub!"  The screen displays a panorama of
desert indistinguishable from any other.
[0;1;32m***
The scene displayed on the north wall grows darker suddenly, as the
whining voice in your head takes on a conspiratorial tone: "B-but far to
the east and north is a w-wonder that puts these others to sh-shame!".
The scene pans across a dark dune field with strange monoliths of some
kind jutting up from the sand here and there.  "The cemetary of the
Ones From Beyond!  Oolgorb only knows what mysteries are revealed in
the inscriptions on these t-tombstones!".
[0;1;32m***
The whining voice brightens again as the scene returns to show the city.
"But never f-forget, if you must go into the desert yourself, to t-take
your trusty m-mapping device with you!  The Flakoforeignjive brand
mapping t-tool is made right here in this city from only the f-finest
materials: the KOOTPOD/WAPPLE FASHNORK and the v-very NOODLE we have all
g-grown to know and l-love!  Now available from b-better merchants
everywhere, under the trademark-K-K-" -- the image seems to flicker
suddenly and then turns to bright white.
[0;1;32m***
The wall to your north clears suddenly and lights up with a scene in a
dank, grubby room crowded with aliens sitting at several small, grimy
tables.  The two misanthropic-looking aliens at the table in the
foreground begin to argue heatedly: "Why no I did not never nohow not
touch one of your filthy nebbish!" says one.  The other slaps a tentacle
on the table and declares: "Why my lovely nebbish you then have held
holding there in your filthy fingers?!"...
[0;1;32m***
The two aliens shown in the foreground on the north wall suddenly push
back their chairs and stand.  The first one leans forward and yells: "My
nebbish not never nohow anyhow your filthy nebbish!".  The other slaps
his side-pocket meaningfully and says: "Well my X-gazax-bits SCROOM just
about that something to say might have!"  The first alien appears taken
aback, then suddenly turns and starts to run for the door.
[0;1;32m***
The scene on the north wall shows the alien running for the door suddenly
flipping over backwards, goods of all sorts spilling out of his pockets
onto the floor.  The scene shifts to show the other alien blowing coolly
across the muzzle of his unholstered scroom, then undulating casually
over to snatch up the nebbish the first one had dropped.  Another, more
mature voice now eases in over the uproar: "Be sure.  Be protected.
Talk softly but carry your X-gazax-bits SCROOM with you at all times."...
[0;1;32m***
The scene on the north wall shows the first alien picking himself up
from the floor and dusting himself off while the other aliens in the
area scramble after his lost possessions.  With what appears to be a
rueful look on what you suppose to be his face, he says: "Well I didn't
never nohow mean not to take your nebbish.  That's one right decent
SCROOM you have there pardner.  What's say we be friends?".
[0;1;32m***
The north wall returns to a sort of opaque mistiness as the lights in
the hall slowly come up to full brightness again.
[0;1;32m***
The room through the portal to your east is suddenly becoming light
again!
[0;1;32m***
The room through the portal to your north is suddenly becoming light
again!
[0;1;32m***
The room through the portal to your west is suddenly becoming light
again!
[0;1;32m***
Giant floodlights in the ceiling suddenly turn on, revealing a huge,
intricate machine of some sort in the center of the room, with a pale
orange corona surrounding it.  A chute, leading into the machine, is off
to one side.
[0;1;32m***
The giant floodlights in the ceiling suddenly turn off, leaving you
in complete darkness.
[0;1;32m***
One of the floating globules just touched your mongoo, and they both
vanished in a cloud of smoke!
[0;1;32m***
The coils in the area to your east have just started to hum and glow!
[0;1;32m***
A humming sound suddenly starts up in the room to your west!
[0;1;32m***
A humming sound suddenly starts up in the room to your south!

[0;1;32m***
The air suddenly feels full of an indefinable energy rushing in all
directions!
[0;1;32m...Nothing seems to happen.
[0;1;32m...It doesn't work, the button seems to be locked up somehow.
[0;1;32m...The box opens up, and a traset falls out!
[0;1;32m***
A traset falls out of the box onto the floor!
[0;1;32m...The box appears to be empty.
[0;1;32m...The box opens up, and a rebozo falls out!

[0;1;32m...A voice seems to single itself out from the swirling cacophony:

[0;1;32m...A voice seems to single itself out from the swirling cacophony:

[0;1;32m...The kootpod appears to be made of five cylindrical pieces which come together
in a central hub made of some kind of glass.  Dimly through the glass you can
see some kind of mechanism inside.  The outer faces of the cylinders appear to
glow most of the time.
[0;1;32m...The dongle is a glowing purple sphere about the size of a baseball, with
thousands of tiny little holes perforating its surface.  Light seems to dance
across the face of the dongle as you turn it this way and that.
[0;1;32m...The bagloon is a complicated-looking affair, with tubing and strange
crystalline wires covering its exterior.  It has two handles situated on one
side, across from what appears to be a focusing mechanism of some sort.
[0;1;32m...The felafel is a sort of thin hemisphere formed out of a very fine wire
mesh.  Near one end there is a tiny black box embedded in the mesh.
[0;1;32m...The zarkon is a dull black sphere about the size of a golf ball.  It seems
very heavy, and it even appears to be getting heavier all the time, although
this is probably an illusion.
[0;1;32m...The kwish has three lobes protruding out from it symmetrically in all directions,
as though it were formed by merging three tennis balls partway together.  In
the middle is a triangular hole, and on one side is a little button.
[0;1;32m...The snalt is a cube of cool clear crystalline material with a glowing green
sphere embedded in its center.
[0;1;32m...The quorum is a round red box made of some hard, brittle substance.  It has
a large red button on one face, with a glowing gold ring around it.
[0;1;32m...The fracas is a wide, metallic green disk, bowed out a little in the center,
as though it were a section of a sphere.  There seems to be a handle of some
sort protruding from the middle of the concave side, formed of three rounded
tetrahedra that meet in the center of the disk.
[0;1;32m...The dweezle consists of a solid hemispherical section of a milky-white color
and a cube-like section attached to the hemisphere in the middle of its flat
side.  There appears to be a pushbutton on one side of the cube.
[0;1;32m...The kootpod appears to be made of five cylindrical pieces which come together
in a central hub made of some kind of glass.  Dimly through the glass you can
see some kind of mechanism inside.  The outer faces of the cylinders appear
to glow most of the time.
[0;1;32m...The wapple consists of a blue toroid connected by a long thin wire to a
switch.  The wire is only partly solid in that it can pass through itself
without getting tangled, but it cannot be stretched beyond a certain length.
[0;1;32m...The bagloon is a complicated-looking affair, with tubing and strange
crystalline wires covering its exterior.  It has two handles situated on one
side, across from what appears to be a focusing mechanism of some sort.
[0;1;32m...The nebbish looks like a set of three parallel transparent tubes held
together by a sheet of red fire.  A pistol-grip-type handle on the bottom
allows for easy carrying of the device.
[0;1;32m...The quahog is a complicated collection of elements, all interconnected by
glowing lines of energy.  A spark shoots out of its interior from time to
time.  A glowing corona of ionized air surrounding it seems to always trap the
sparks before they can do any damage.
[0;1;32m...The wongum appears to be an amorphous energy field of a light green color.
It will not allow your hands to compress it beyond a certain point, but it
does not have a definite shape either.  Little flashes of light escape from it
periodically.
[0;1;32m...The narret is a featureless gold sphere about the size of a basketball.  It
seems to weigh about ten pounds.
[0;1;32m...The quahog is a complicated collection of elements, all interconnected by
glowing lines of energy.  A spark shoots out of its interior from time to

[0;1;32m...The greeb is a long thin tube of some sort of thick metallic mesh, wound
around itself in a spiral pattern.  Iridescent patterns of light play over
its surface.  The ends of the tube are transparent, and a sparkling light of
some kind can be seen inside.
[0;1;32m...The drivel is a group of four boxes arranged in a square pattern with a
small spacing between them.  Thin transparent rods seem to be what holds the
boxes to together.  There is a button on the underside of one of the boxes.
[0;1;32m...The quahog is a complicated collection of elements, all interconnected by
glowing lines of energy.  A spark shoots out of its interior from time to
time.  A glowing corona of ionized air surrounding it seems to always trap the

[0;1;32m...The foonprize is a bright silver dodecahedron, about an inch in diameter.
It seems to weigh about a pound.
[0;1;32m...The narn appears to be a hodgepodge of miscellaneous elements, all held
together by some sort of attractive force at the center.  It seems to shoot
out waves of some unknown type in all directions once every few seconds.
[0;1;32m...The zleen is a small round furry creature with big beady eyes, a cute
little black nose, and great white whiskers.  It does not appear to have any
legs, but it is able to wiggle all around in a rubbery sort of way.
[0;1;32m...The noodle is a foamy mass of blue goop that somehow manages to keep from
coming apart or sticking to your skin.
[0;1;32m...The flungoon is a flat golden disk, with raised edges.  It has little bumps
covering its surface that look as though they might erupt at any moment.
[0;1;32m...The scroom is a short, menacing-looking section of black tube, with a
pistol-grip handle on one end and an antenna sticking partway out the other.
Little red lights run up and down one side of the tube.
[0;1;32m...The rebozo is shaped something like a flying saucer, with two gently curved
surfaces meeting at a sharp edge.  It makes very soft beeping noises, and is
much heavier on one side than on the other.
[0;1;32m...The fashnork has three arms coming out of a thin midsection, each arm
terminating in a stub end.  On one end of the midsection there is a glowing
gold button.
[0;1;32m...The ceeveese is a hand-sized black box with three little white spheres
sticking out of one end.  The other end appears to have a little rectangular
bezel on it, as though there were some sort of display or readout within the
bezel.
[0;1;32m...The quice is a round furry thing.  It would be difficult to say whether it
is alive or not, just from looking at it.  However, it feels warm to the
touch, and it makes a whooshing sound every now and then.
[0;1;32m...The kootpod appears to be made of five cylindrical pieces which come
together in a central hub made of some kind of glass.  Dimly through the
glass you can see some kind of mechanism inside.  The outer faces of the
cylinders appear to glow most of the time.
[0;1;32m...The snaack is a set of thick metal plates bolted together and supported by
some sort of antigravity field so that it is possible to carry it.  There is
a button located in the middle of the plate on the front end.
[0;1;32m...The babbalisk is a glowing reddish ball with six short spikes protruding
from it in all directions.  In between two of the spikes there appears to be
a little door, which is closed.
[0;1;32m...The quilbert is a cylinder about a foot long, with a cube of some sort of
spongy plastic attached to one end.  As you tilt it back and forth, something
sounds as though it is rolling around inside.
[0;1;32m...The desk is a slab of some purplish metal, held to the floor by a series of
thin rods running down its center.  An inscription on the desk reads: LIVE
USERS HAVE MORE FUN!  The desk does not appear to have any drawers.
[0;1;32m...The dirt is just plain old dirt.
[0;1;32m...The slot is in the shape of a hexagon, about the size of a coin.  There are
little scratches around its edges, as though something metallic has been
inserted into it many times.
[0;1;32m...The slot is about the size of your fist, and is shaped like the outline of
an egg.  Peering into it, you see nothing but a black hole.
[0;1;32m...The map is very faded.  About the only thing you can make out on it is a
little red x with some lettering beside it that looks as though it might
read "You Are Here".
[0;1;32m...The osmotic is a large hemisphere with a perfectly smooth, mirror-like
finish.  The flat side of the hemisphere hovers an inch or two off the floor,
with no visible means of support.
[0;1;32m...The cases are made of some sort of transparent crystal, with bands of some
silvery metal along the corners.  They are filled with some really weird
substance.
[0;1;32m...The substance is ...well... weird.  It can't really be described, it is
so strange.
[0;1;32m...The globe is huge, at least 50 feet in diameter.  It is glowing over its
entire surface with a pearly white light.

[0;1;32m...The gate is a small set of hinged panels that swing freely on soundless
hinges.  It seems to be made of a purplish metal.
[0;1;32m...The gate is a magnificent tall opening in the city wall, with fancy
scrollery engraved into the stone all around it.
[0;1;32m...The instructions say:
"Foon-Ball is played with a ysmaric virtual ball in a holographically
projected playing field just above eye level.  There are seven regions
in the playfield, arranged in a figure-eight pattern.  Fong is in the
center; the left-hand lobe of the figure consists of, in clockwise
order, ormush, kleng, and noodiddle; and the right-hand lobe encompasses
pleebor, oomwazzitz, and neblin.
"The object of the game is to slap the foon-ball just as it finishes
tracing a path of three consecutive positions that follow the
figure-eight.  For example, ormush-fong-pleebor is a winning pattern;
but oomwazzitz-neblin-noodiddle is not.  Most non-winning slaps are not
fatal.  HOWEVER: Any attempt to slap the foon-ball just after it has
"crossed the middle" of either lobe of the playfield results in a loss
to the player that slapped the ball.
"Any number can play at once -- drop a gwingus in the slot to begin
a match."
[0;1;32m...The lights are little tiny point sources, fitted together in a grid pattern
with no more than one or two millimeters between them.  They are all changing
color constantly in a seemingly random pattern.
[0;1;32m...The machine consists of three components: one, a smooth purple spheroid,
with a flat section facing outwards; secondly, a complex little arrangement of nebbers, all
clustered around a zelfwaddle; and third, a collection of pulley-like mechanisms,
which adorn what appears to be a conduit leading up to a chute, accessible at waist
level.  The whole machine is suffused with a gentle orange light, surrounding it like
a corona.
[0;1;32m...The wheel is shaped like a concave dish, with little dividers running out
from the center, separating regions that alternate red and black in color.
Each region seems to have a little number inscribed in it, and the numbers
run from 1 up to 36.  A small silver metal ball is resting in one of the
regions, held in place by the dividers on either side.
[0;1;32m...The grinfrazzitz is composed of a set of vertical bars set into the floor,
with rings of some crystalline substance wrapped around the bars.  Built into
the base of the grinfrazzitz is a small control panel, with a pushbutton on it.
[0;1;32m...The tables are made of a purplish metal, and consist of flat slabs turned
down at the ends with silvery poles extending from the slab edges down to the
floor.
[0;1;32m...The sparks are of all kinds, from great balls of fire to tiny specks.  Some
are diffuse and nebulous, others sharp and intense.  They are all flying out
of the walls continuously at great speed, but they seem to pass through and
by you without doing you any more harm than occasionally singeing your
whiskers.
[0;1;32m...It's thick, deep pile of some unknown material.
[0;1;32m...The stars like dust are all around, forming great swaths of glittering
color.  Three of them seem particularly bright, one slightly reddish, one
somewhat blue, and one a pale purple.
[0;1;32m...There's nothing remarkable about it.
[0;1;32m...The machinery is almost too alien and complicated to describe.  Hundreds of
channels running out of it feed into the long tube in various ways, and little
chatterings and flickerings within it attest to some sort of activity going
on, but what that activity might be, you cannot tell.
[0;1;32m...The panel has just one large blue button in its center, which seems to be
glowing faintly.  The four lights are small hemispheres arrayed across the
top of the panel, one green, one blue, one gold, and one white.
[0;1;32m...The hopper is shaped like an inverted cone, about three feet in diameter.
It appears to be made of some shiny greyish-green material.
[0;1;32m...It's a clean, sparse console with two lights and a pushbutton.  The
pushbutton is labelled "S".
[0;1;32m...The buttons are shaped like little ovals, one blue, one red, one green, one
yellow, and one purple.  They are arranged in a vertical line about four feet
off the floor on the south wall of the room.
[0;1;32m...The globes are filled with a swirling gas of some kind that upon closer
examination seems to be made up of three separate gases that don't mix.  Tiny
sparkling lights fly about between the separate components as they swirl
around each other.
[0;1;32m...The desk appears to be a solid block of some metallic gold material.  No
drawers or apertures of any kind are visible.
[0;1;32m...The light pattern is a constantly changing swirl of vibrant colors.  It
flits about the room from wall to wall and floor to ceiling in a wild sort of
dancing motion.  It is difficult to look at for very long without getting a
headache.

[0;1;32m...The granfalloon is composed of a series of vertical sections of dull gold
material, attached together horizontally with black cylinders.  In the face
of the granfalloon is a wide slot, and a strange dish-shaped device
protruding from the upper part of it seems to focus at a spot on the floor
right in front of the device.
[0;1;32m...The benches are of a wide, straight-backed design, and seem to be made of
a purplish metal.
[0;1;32m...The ribbenfratz has three large tubes running up from the floor into a red
cube with a slot in its side.  Three bars run out horizontally from the cube
and disappear into the wall to the west.
[0;1;32m...The globules seem to glow a dim orange as they float about the room.  They
are almost transparent but they have a slight milkiness to them, a little
like jellyfish.
[0;1;32m...The light is eerie, indefinable.  It seems faintly menacing somehow.
[0;1;32m...The coils are made of some type of crystalline tubing about six inches in
diameter, and are wound into a series of great loops several feet wide and
twenty to thirty feet long.  A long thick cylinder of the same crystalline
material seems to run down the center of the coils.
[0;1;32m...The hopper appears to be made of a smooth, greyish-green material.  Its
mouth is about three feet wide, and it narrows down to a foot or so in width
at its base, where it merges with the floor.  Peering down into the hopper,
you see a faintly shimmering curtain of light covering the aperture at the
bottom.
[0;1;32m...The desks are I-shaped sections of some purplish metal, arrayed in five
rows of three each.  They don't appear to have any drawers or concealed
compartments of any kind.
[0;1;32m...It's just a simple console with one button and one light.
[0;1;32m...It appears to be some form of dynamic alien art -- very pretty, but of no
ultimate cosmic metasignificance.
[0;1;32m...The box appears to have a hinged door.  There is a pale blue force field
around it that seems to pull the door gently closed once it has been opened.
Otherwise, it looks to be just a plain metal box.
[0;1;32m...The ball is a small reflective silver sphere that seems to be able to roll
around freely within the wheel when it is spun.
[0;1;32m...The gwirg is a little robot, about the size and shape of a beachball, with
a single short antenna sticking out the top.  On its underside you can see a
pale blue sparkling energy field of some sort, which holds it several inches
off the ground.
[0;1;32m...The oolgorboid looks a little like an old, limp piece of broccoli, with
several stems diverging out into a damp green crown.
[0;1;32m...The hieroglyphics consist of three basic groups, arranged left to right:
first, a circle with rectangular bars extending outward from it on the top
and bottom and with two little lines inside of it forming an angle; then a
set of four arrows all pointing inward toward a central point; then a large
black area with tiny white dots in it here and there.
[0;1;32m...The plaque has an inscription on it in what appears to be an alien
language: BQZBJ Z EKTMFNNM NODM!
[0;1;32m...There appear to be some alien runes inscribed on the derelict spaceship:
they appear to read "Jg ju't dpme up uif upvdi, ju xpslt jo uif hsbogbmmppo!".
[0;1;32m...Looking down into the hole, you can just barely make out what appears to be
a huge pile of mongoos at the bottom.
[0;1;32m...The writing on the panel says:
"Umflungoo: Game of the Terminally Unruly
"Drop one mongoo in hole, then start yelling.  First player to yell the
right word wins.  Each yell is matched, letter by letter, to the 'chosen'
word, and everyone is notified of all matches.  Any number can play.
Remember, only yelled guesses count.  Umflungoo Away!"
[0;1;32m...The cylinder has no distinguishing features to speak of.
[0;1;32m...The surface of the hemisphere has a perfectly mirrorlike finish.  Upon close
examination, you notice a faint whirring sound coming from inside it.
[0;1;32m...Inscribed on the monolith is a little poem:
     Statues come and statues go, and
     Statues may be dumb, you know...
     But statues always tell the truth.
     Heed them, for eternal youth.
[0;1;32m...The gwamp is a large blue ring, about the size of an inner tube, with a
perfectly smooth surface.
[0;1;32m...The slosh is a large red ring, about the size of an inner tube, with a
perfectly smooth surface.
[0;1;32m...The tuskaloosa is a large purple ring, about the size of an inner tube,
with a perfectly smooth surface.
[0;1;32m...The freenish is a large, intricate machine of some kind, with little tubes
and odd jutting surfaces sticking out from it here and there.  One of the
larger tubes protrudes out from the face of the freenish, then curves down
and terminates in what would appear to be a spout, although there is nothing
issuing from it at present.  You can see some sort of pale blue fluid
circulating in many of the other tubes, but there is no way to get at it.
[0;1;32m...The freenish is a large, intricate machine of some kind, with little tubes
and odd jutting surfaces sticking out from it here and there.  One of the
larger tubes protrudes out from the face of the freenish, then curves down
and terminates in what would appear to be a spout.  A steady stream of some
sort of pale blue fluid is gushing out of the spout, but it seems to vanish
the instant it hits the ground.
[0;1;32m...The mongooosk is a broad, squat mass of some leathery substance closely
resembling rhinoceros hide.  It is several feet long and perhaps half that
wide, its gently rounded profile above the ground suggesting that most of it
is buried beneath the surface.  Its three sweenars are bobbing gently up and
down in the jungle air.
[0;1;32m...The mongooosk's sweenars appear to be a set of black globes about the size
of bowling balls.  Each sweenar is attached to the end of a thin, flexible
silver shaft that allows it to swing gently back and forth, up and down, in a
hypnotic sort of way.
[0;1;32m...The rock juts out of the ground at a narrow angle, with a crooked sort of
offshoot of it pointing roughly in a northeasterly direction.
[0;1;32m...The ancient spaceship seems to be of conventional design, with a flattened
spheroid-like shape coming to a sharp corner around the rim and what appears
to have once been a hemispherical cap made of some hard transparent material.
The top face of the ship has a set of repeated patterns inscribed around its
surface at 30-degree intervals: each pattern looks like a collection of
oddly-shaped bits of deep red fluff, all thrown together in a group a little
taller than it is wide.
[0;1;32m...The oddlewokkus is an intense energy field, only three or four feet across
but seeming to stretch into the infinite distance as you gaze into it.  Soft,
gauzy curtains of multicolored light seem to swirl around within it, while a
thin mist of glowing gold forms a corona over its entire exterior.
[0;1;32m...The blub is a violent, sparkling energy field, only three or four feet
across but seeming to stretch into the infinite distance as you gaze into it.
Sweeping curtains of multicolored light seem to swirl around within it, while
a thin mist of glowing gold forms a corona over its entire exterior.
[0;1;32m...The nofzinger is a roaring maelstrom of nebulous energy, only three or four
feet across but seeming to stretch into the infinite distance as you gaze into
it.  Turbulent vortices of multicolored light seem to swarm around within it,
while a thin mist of glowing gold forms a corona over its entire exterior.
[0;1;32m...The statue is jet black, about 20 feet tall and perhaps half that in width.
The alien is depicted with its four under-tentacles intertwined beneath it in
almost a braid-like pattern, and its fifth, or upper, tentacle drooping
lazily off to the side in a contemplative sort of way.
[0;1;32m...Inscribed on the monolith are the words:
COORDINATE 2, DIGIT 3: 9
[0;1;32m...The orb is a sphere perhaps 20 feet in diameter, with a pearly white
translucent surface.  It has a sense of expectancy about it, as if it has
been waiting here for you all along.
[0;1;32m...The pedestal is a squared-off section of something resembling fine granite.
One face of the pedestal has a glyph inlaid into it in colored stone, which
looks like a pearly white circle with a red ring inside it.
[0;1;32m...Inscribed on the monolith are the words:
COORDINATE 1, DIGIT 2: 4
[0;1;32m...Inscribed on the monolith are the words:

[0;1;32m...The platform is made of a hard, blue metal that seems to have undergone
centuries of weathering since the time it was new, judging by the smooth,
worn appearance of the corners.
[0;1;32m...The fluid is a thin, pale shade of blue.  It appears to be filled with
millions of tiny bubbles that sparkle brightly in the sunlight.
[0;1;32m...The gwingus wobbles around in your hands uncertainly for a moment and then
lies still.
[0;1;32m***
A blue beam shoots out of the sepper, covering the east wall!  Suddenly, a
rectangular opening in the wall appears, slowly at first, but then growing
wider and wider until a corridor leading east is clearly visible!  The air
becomes positively dense with the smell of ozone.
[0;1;32m***
You see a bright blue light through the hazy curtain to the west!  The
curtain itself starts to dissolve, leaving a clear opening connecting the
corridor you're in with the room to the west.  The smell of ozone has become
almost overpowering here.
[0;1;32m***
You hear a sizzling, hissing sound from the building to the south!
[0;1;32m***
A white beam shoots out of the palt, covering the wall!  Suddenly, the
rectangular opening in the wall begins to disappear, slowly at first, but
then growing dimmer and dimmer until the corridor leading east has
completely vanished.
[0;1;32m***
You see a bright white light to the west!  Almost immediately, a hazy
curtain starts to form over the opening connecting you with the room to the
west... it gets thicker and thicker until you can only barely make out the
outlines of the room beyond.
[0;1;32m***
You hear a sizzling, hissing sound from the building to the south!
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the nebbish seems to be getting warmer!
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the nebbish seems to be getting cooler!
[0;1;32m...You seem to feel a sense of finality setting in, as though some irreversible
process has just been set in motion.
[0;1;32m...It seems to suddenly whirl around your body and land back in your hands!
(but it is difficult to be sure...)
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the gwirg lifts you up off the floor and begins taking you higher and
higher up into the black tower... above you you see something glowing bright
gold, growing nearer, and nearer...
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly you find yourself sinking down into the floor, then dropping down,
down, down.  Far below you see the patch of light at the entry to the tower
growing nearer, and nearer...
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the gwirg begins to move upward momentarily but stops abruptly as
though changing its mind and then lays still.
[0;1;32m...You suddenly hear a great rushing sound all around you, as a thin vertical
line of deep red fire appears in the air a few feet away!  Your rebozo suddenly
begins to ooze into your fingers, filling your body with scintillating energy,
as the line of red fire gets brighter and brighter, gradually broadening out to
become a wide column of red fire.  The column begins to move toward you, and
suddenly you are sucked into it!  The roaring in your ears rushes up to a
crescendo and then dies away, as your vision slowly clears...

suddenly it seems to reset itself, and begins to cool off again.

[0;1;32m...Your noodle hums suddenly, and you feel reality begin to fade away as another
world forms around you 
[0;1;32m.. Reality fades away again and then re-forms, and you are back where you were.
[0;1;32m***
You feel an intense wave of heat for the blink of an eye, as your fashnork
suddenly flashes bright red and then vanishes in a soundless explosion!  A
faint smell of burnt insulation is all it leaves behind.
[0;1;32m***
You feel an intense wave of heat for the blink of an eye, as something nearby
suddenly flashes bright red and then vanishes in a soundless explosion!  You
catch a faint smell of burnt insulation in the air.
[0;1;32m...The fashnork suddenly sends eerie vibrations through your entire being and
you begin to notice your body and all your holdings becoming transparent!
Soon you have become completely invisible, although you can still tell what
you are holding by touch.
[0;1;32m...You feel suddenly warm, as a strange shimmering appears in the air beneath
your eyes!  Gradually a body takes form around you, and upon examination you
find it to be your own!  You have become fully visible once again.
[0;1;32m is suddenly turning transparent, more and more, until at last he has
become completely invisible!
[0;1;32m***
A strange shimmering starts up in the air a few feet away, becoming more and
more solid until at last 
[0;1;32m***
Your fracas suddenly hums madly for a moment!
[0;1;32m***
A giant steel claw suddenly shoots out of the babbalisk toward 
[0;1;32m but the quahog instantly shines a strange purple ray at it!  The claw
writhes around in the air as if in agony, then abruptly retracts back into
the babbalisk!

A giant steel claw suddenly shoots out of

[0;1;32m...You sense the snuge sending you a telepathic message: "Attach me to a
wigglesnort!  Attach me to a wigglesnort!"
[0;1;32m***
The bilge suddenly breaks out with some sort of recorded message: "Protect your
belongings!  Avoid worry!  Forget about theft!  Buy the X-gazax-bits factory-
guaranteed FELAFEL today!"
[0;1;32m...The bork begins sending images into your mind of a dark subterranean
corridor, a set of glowing coils, a large hopper, and a control panel...
somehow the number 4 becomes imprinted on your brain.
[0;1;32m...You sense the rhubarb transmitting alien, alien thought patterns that are
almost impossible to decipher... about all you seem to be able to pick up is
something about a room with chromium plated walls, high, high up in a jet-black
tower...
[0;1;32m***
The moolkoo suddenly yells: "Look out, Jim, the grinfrazzitz is starting up
again!  It's -- look out!  It's -- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaakccckkckkcckkk!"
[0;1;32m...A little readout in the kwish you hadn't noticed before lights up all
of a sudden.  You watch as a strange stream of digits slowly parades past on
the readout: 84 85 66 85 86 70 84 44 78 80 79 80 77 74 85 73 84 62 72 66 77 66
89 70 79 85 70 83...
[0;1;32m...Suddenly a little cable shoots out of the side of the rommus and attaches
itself to your ear!  You begin to hear a little voice through the wire saying,
"Help!"  Suddenly the little cable retracts back into the rommus.
[0;1;32m***
The ruckus suddenly emits a series of tones and then says:
"Where there's a will, there's inheritance tax!"
[0;1;32m...The bundle suddenly begins beaming thoughts at you... First, an image of a
curved surface with millions of tiny lights embedded in it; then, a set of
four lights in a control console; then, a single one of the four lights, which
suddenly lights up!
[0;1;32m...The quorum seems to suddenly expand and expand, until it is all around you
and you are inside it!  A strange pale blue light surrounds you, and suddenly
you hear a voice that seems to come from all directions at once: "Does your
voice not project as far as you would like?  Are your friends always out of
earshot when you need them?  Consider investing in the Klong-Frenetix DONGLE,
the subspace-powered, ion-free voice projection device with the exclusive
Autoseek feature!  Buy one this month only, and Klong-Frenetix will include a
flatspace Automute bubble for free!"  The pale blue light then coalesces back
into the quorum, leaving you standing as before.
[0;1;32m***
The wapple suddenly glows a deep purple, and you hear a strange whooshing and
whirring that gradually builds up from the edge of hearing until it begins to
sound almost like music.  A thin, wailing voice now becomes audible, singing:
     South from mesa fiven walks,
     Stumble I to rising sun,
     Then to find the Orb That Talks,
     South but one, and one, and one.
The singing dies away softly on the word "one".
[0;1;32m...Your mind feels suddenly burst open, as if an ethereal scalpel had just
passed directly through your skull!  You feel an alien presence probing around
in your brain... thrusting here... poking there...  You catch little wisps of
thought from the presence: "where are they from?"... "do they know about the
noodle and the drivel?"... "have they found the metastatic transfer chamber
yet?"... "what color are the sparks?"... "is --" -- suddenly the thoughts are
interrupted and you feel the presence depart as control of your brain is
restored to you.
[0;1;32m...Suddenly you feel suspended in a vast black void with tiny points of light
embedded in it above you, under you, all around you.  A ring of bright red
light suddenly appears to encircle you and then shoot away from you at enormous
speed, receding into the distance until it surrounds only a single one of the
points of light.  A soundless explosion throughout your body seems to say:
CCOFFOGGNNORRAA!  Now a blue ring of light encircles you and shoots away in a
different direction, receding to pinpoint another star, and you feel yourself
resonate to the word: GGALLAXXENNTTERR!  Then, a purple ring shoots away in a
third direction, with the word: FFARRSSHHONN!  Then, you feel support beneath
your feet return as reality coalesces around you.
[0;1;32m...You feel a strange sensation in your head, as though something were trying
to warn you of danger!  A hazy image fights its way into your mind, a sort of
cylinder, with a cube of some indistinct material attached to one end.  Then a
sort of silvery sphere with an antenna on top jumps out at you, with a giant
open mouth!  You feel a moment of sheer terror, and then the vision subsides.
[0;1;32m...You sense the noodle beaming a vague mix of impressions at you of many
different scenes, most of them strangely familiar, but no single impression is
distinct enough for you to tell what it is.
[0;1;32m...You begin to feel a sense of dreamy peace, as though floating out above the
desert on a soft blue cloud... looking down, you see the city, and off to the
southwest of it a diagonal row of four giant statues... then you notice a
peculiar hidden trail in the desert, leading west from the statues a few
miles... lazily following the trail with your eyes, you see it turn north for
about twice as far as it went west, and then turn west again... and then
perhaps north, or possibly east, or somewhere, who cares, it is all so restful
here... the scene clears and you are back where you were, feeling considerably
refreshed.
[0;1;32m...The snaack suddenly begins sending out tiny vibrations that you seem to hear
more with your bones than with your ears:
    "North to dune is known to all,
     West to rune is where some fall,
     West again by two is where
     Those who then face north may dare
     Step two! And if they then step forth
     East five, and then go wand'ring north
     For three, too, one thing they must know
     Is which way after this to go."
[0;1;32m***
The cacapoo explodes into millions of tiny points of light!  The air is
suddenly filled with them as they flutter about, seeming to seek positions in
the air, and as their light grows fainter, they seem to come together to form
two figures in the air, one of them a transparent cube with a hole in the
center, and the other a set of three spherical lobes of some kind.  Then the
glow of the lights grows dimmer and goes out, leaving only empty air behind.
[0;1;32m...Suddenly the orb seems to swirl and glow, and the image of a powerful column
of red fire appears inside it!  Then a deep, droning voice solemnly intones:
     A thousand years I've waited
     I'll wait a thousand more
     Rebozo's sweet caress, you know
     Is power, to the core.
[0;1;32m***
You suddenly feel a sense of vertigo as the world around you seems to swirl and
tumble in a panoramic alien image superimposed on reality: you see molecules
being ripped apart as tiny white wavicles of anti-matter penetrate into their
innermost recesses; then, you seem to fly back at enormous speed as your field
of view enlarges to show a large rectangular opening in a wall, with tiny wisps
of vapor drifting in the air and slowly disappearing; then the image fades
away...
[0;1;32m***
You suddenly feel a sense of vertigo as the world around you seems to swirl and
tumble in a panoramic alien image superimposed on reality: you see giant
transparent cubes tumbling through space, with entire planetary systems and
nebulae flashing through them like giant sparks!  Then the image fades and you
are back in everyday reality...
[0;1;32m***
You suddenly feel a sense of vertigo as the world around you seems to swirl and
tumble in a panoramic alien image superimposed on reality: you see the cubes
tumbling through space again, and a set of aliens inside the cubes going
through a series of strange motions, almost like a dance, as the cubes change
color abruptly in a crazy-quilt of patterns!  Then the image fades as your
sense of reality re-establishes itself...
[0;1;32m***
You suddenly feel a sense of vertigo as the world around you seems to swirl and
tumble in a panoramic alien image superimposed on reality: you flash back to
aliens in cubes!  The cubes change color again and again as the nebulae flash
through them -- and suddenly, as all the cubes change to blue, a vast blue
glowing field of some kind balloons out from the cubes and begins drawing
energy from the stars!
[0;1;32m***
The room darkens, and you hear an eerie whistling sound as the ysmaric
foon-ball appears!
[0;1;32m***
There is a bright flash of light, and suddenly the winner's name appears
in deep orange, holographically projected all across the ceiling:
     
[0;1;32m is the winner!
Then the room lights come up to normal brightness again.
[0;1;32m***
You hear a loud, objectionable sound, like a honking wheeze.  Then a little
light just above the slot comes on, blinking: "
[0;1;32m blew it!"  Slowly, the
room lights return to normal brightness again.
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the foon-ball vanishes!  A little light comes on over the slot,
blinking: "Tie game!"  Then the room lights slowly come up to normal
brightness again.
[0;1;32m
...You have entered the Foon-Ball Emporium.  The room lights are darkened,
causing the seven holographically-shaded regions of the playfield to stand out
in stark relief against the ceiling.  A game is in progress, and the ysmaric
foon-ball is in motion!
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly three crackers pour out of the slot into your hands!
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly you see three crackers pour out of the slot, into 
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly you hear a great grinding noise coming from the slot!
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the west wall lights up bright white as the game begins!
[0;1;32m...You're in the Hall of Umflungoo, an auditorium-sized room with Umflungoo
banners hanging from the rafters.  There is a large circular hole in the middle
of the floor; portals lead out of the hall to the north and south.  The west
wall is brightly lit -- apparently a game is in progress!
[0;1;32m***
You hear a blast of escaping air from the direction of the hole, and a message
appears in dancing blue letters on the west wall: "No winner this time.  The
word was '
[0;1;32m'".  Then the lettering fades away.
[0;1;32m***
You hear a giant shriek as the whole room lights up bright orange and the
entire west wall is covered over with the word 
[0;1;32m!  Suddenly, to the accompaniment of trumpets, you see 
[0;1;32m written all over the walls, floor, and ceiling, in four foot
high purple letters!  Then the lettering fades away as the lights
return to normal.
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the west wall lights up in bright gold with the letters:
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the osmotic belches loudly, emits a booming roar, and bellows: "I
WANNA 
[0;1;32m...You're standing on a broad covered walkway running north and south between
the gate to the jungle to the north and a strange small building to the south.
The words "OSMOTIC IN USE" appear to be floating in space just above the
entrance to the building.  Also, there is a crooked little pathway leading off
to the west.
[0;1;32m***
You hear a booming roar coming from the strange little building to the south!
[0;1;32m***
You hear a booming roar from the west!
[0;1;32m***
The osmotic emits a crashing, ear-splitting roar, and then thunders: "I HAVE
BEEN SATISFIED! 
[0;1;32m SHALL HAVE THE ZLEEN!"
[0;1;32m***
The osmotic suddenly makes a strange grinding sound, shudders, and then goes
silent.  You seem to hear a faint voice inside go "Bleah! 
[0;1;32m sucks!" (but it is difficult to tell for sure).
[0;1;32m***
The osmotic suddenly roars out: "I WANNA 
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the osmotic shudders and makes a strange sighing sound, as though
becoming resigned to its fate.
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the osmotic emits a deafening roar, and bellows: "HOW".
[0;1;32m***
The osmotic suddenly roars out: "HOW??  RACE TO SATISFY THE OSMOTIC!!  FEED ANY
OBJECT INTO THE OSMOTIC AND IT WILL ASK FOR ANOTHER, AT RANDOM, BASED ON THE
LEVEL OF THE OBJECT FED!!  THE FIRST PLAYER TO CREATE THE STATED OBJECT AND
FEED IT TO THE OSMOTIC SHALL BE ENTITLED TO A ZLEEN!!  RACE, RACE TO SATISFY
THE OSMOTIC!!

Suddenly the little gwirg whirrs for a moment and then chirps out:
"This way to the oolgorboid!!"

The gwirg suddenly scurries away to the

A little gwirg suddenly scurries up to you from the

Suddenly a remarkable little gwirg floats down out of the sky and begins
whirring breathlessly around your feet!
[0;1;32m...You're in the middle of a dense tropical forest.  Overhead, the jungle
canopy filters out all but a few flickering rays of blue sunlight, and, except
for the oolgorboid lying off to the side, the jungle surrounds you to the
north, south, east, and west as far as the eye can see.
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the gwirg whirls around, snarls, and jumps into your hands!
***
The gwirg just ate your quilbert!
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly the gwirg whirls around, snarls, and jumps into

Suddenly the earth begins to tremble and shake!

A deep, resounding voice fills the room:
  "WHAT ZLEEN IS THIS WHO DARES ATTEMPT THE INFINITE LOOP?
   A POX UPON THEE, ZLEEN!"
[0;1;32m***
You suddenly feel the earth tremble and shake beneath your feet!
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly you begin to feel very light and airy!  The light in the hall becomes
bright, brighter -- intensely bright as you feel yourself floating up off the
floor.  Then suddenly, you are sucked into the chute!
***
You are totally disoriented as you feel the molecules of your zleen
intermingling with, merging with your own... you hear a fizzing, popping sound
as you are deposited on the floor beside the smooth purple spheroid.  You are
your zleen!
[0;1;32m suddenly looks thunderstruck -- floats up off the floor for a
moment -- and then gets sucked into the chute!

A giant shimmering zleen-form suddenly materializes in the air a few feet away!
Gradually it becomes substantial, sizzling and popping briefly as it merges
with your plane of existence... and then you recognize it.  It is

she has a long, bushy handlebar mustache.  She

of Arc.  She

[0;1;32m is a friendly-looking sort, with a perpetual half-smile on her face.  You
get the feeling that she might need money.  She
[0;1;32m is the strange, dwarf-growing type.  She has four pet parrots: one on
her head, one on each shoulder, and one perched on the toe of her left shoe.  She
[0;1;32m looks like the femme fatale type.  She has a black patch over her
left eye, and has long, greasy black hair.  She

end.  Short jets of what appears to be steam shoot out of her ears from time
to time.  She
[0;1;32m is constantly smiling about in all directions as you watch.  Her face
seems to exhibit a nervous twitch that makes her appear to be winking at
everyone around you, as though sharing some private joke.  She
[0;1;32m is about three feet tall, and has enormous feet, which at the moment
are encased in equally enormous shiny black shoes.  You sense the faint smell
of Dr. Scholl's emanating from her general direction.  She
[0;1;32m looks as though she has recently been to a costume party.  She is dressed
as a prehistoric city-dweller, with a "dress", and "stockings" on her legs
(these were thin nylon tubes which fully enclosed the legs -- the theory was
that the nylon would instantly run, thereby encouraging males to privately
speculate as to just how far the run extended).  She
[0;1;32m is surrounded by a faintly glowing aura of leashed energy.  She is about
seven feet tall, dark-haired, with what appears to be an old fencing scar on her
left cheek.  She
[0;1;32m is surrounded by a faintly glowing aura of leashed energy.  She is about
eight feet tall, dark-haired, with what appears to be the scar of an old

six feet tall, light-haired, with what appears to be an old fishing scar on her
right cheek.  She
[0;1;32m looks like the impatient sort.  Her sweaty face is a dark shade of
purple, and she seems to be tapping one foot on the ground so fast that you
can barely see it.  She
[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if she would like to
give you some crackers.  She
[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if she has a father-in-law
named Ferd.  She

hidden away somewhere.  She
[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if she is working on
a novel in her spare time.  She
[0;1;32m has become a small bread-basket, with a shelf-life of several weeks.
A small sign over her head blinks repeatedly: "Fish No More".  She
[0;1;32m is apparently undergoing a metamorphosis from the form of a
hippopotamus to that of a buttercup.  A soft wheezing sound emits from her left
armpit/leaf-structure, a portion of her anatomy you decide you would just as
soon not investigate further.  She
[0;1;32m is wearing a name-badge identifying herself as an Inspector of
Unspecified Proportionalities, but you notice that the green headdress normally
accorded such functionaries is conspicuously missing.  She
[0;1;32m has become almost uniformly orange, but you notice a small mole just
beneath her left ear that seems to be blinking on and off in a shade of
pale yellow.  She
[0;1;32m is surrounded by a cloud of small, gnat-like creatures, all singing
in unison, "When the Saints Come Marching In".  She seems to be enjoying
the music, as far as you can tell.  She
[0;1;32m has the look of a furtive desperado about her, but you feel certain
that her mother loves her.  Looking closely, you notice a small tear forming
in the corner of her right eye.  She
[0;1;32m is apparently masquerading as the Duchess of Wales, but the raccoon
nesting in her left ear is a dead giveaway.  She is trying to combat the smell
of the dead raccoon with Eau de Vivre, but to no avail.  She
[0;1;32m has a serious case of Uncorgling's Disease, which makes her seem much
less unpopular than she actually is.  A spare set of kelp bladders is dangling
on a chain from her belt.  She
[0;1;32m has the look of a woman plotting the overthrow of the galaxy.
Unfortunately, she cannot seem to escape the holographic image of the small
backyard rotisserie that follows her around, sometimes in front, sometimes
behind.  She
[0;1;32m has a distracted look about her, as though torn between a desire to
discover new life, new civilizations, and a desire to eat some fresh
marmalade.  Why she supposes these are mutually exclusive, you cannot tell.  She
[0;1;32m appears to be wearing a special projector that makes her nose seem
several times its actual size.  However, the small radar dome on her head
forces you to conclude that she works for the military.  She
[0;1;32m is appropriately attired for the occasion in a high-necked, stiff
white collar and blue velvet bellbottoms.  You seem to recall having seen
her before on one of those tri-D newscasts.  She
[0;1;32m has evidently gotten fed up with feeding the rabbits all the time,
since she has no grass pellets anywhere on her person.  However, looking closely,
you notice the telltale chlorophyll stains on the thumb and forefinger
of her left hand.  She
[0;1;32m is a plain-looking girl, with a sweet smile.  She

[0;1;32m is a small round furry creature with big beady eyes, a cute little
black nose, and great white whiskers.  It does not appear to have any legs, but
it is able to wiggle all around in a rubbery sort of way.  It

green skin.  He has an honest face.  He
[0;1;32m is a friendly-looking sort, with a perpetual half-smile on his face.  You
get the feeling that he might need money.  He
[0;1;32m is the rugged, individualistic type.  He has four pet parrots: one on
his head, one on each shoulder, and one perched on the toe of his left shoe.  He

end.  Short jets of what appears to be steam shoot out of his ears from time
to time.  He
[0;1;32m is constantly smiling about in all directions as you watch.  His face
seems to exhibit a nervous twitch that makes him appear to be winking at
everyone around you, as though sharing some private joke.  He
[0;1;32m is about three feet tall, and has enormous feet, which at the moment
are encased in equally enormous shiny black shoes.  You sense the faint smell
of Dr. Scholl's emanating from his general direction.  He
[0;1;32m looks as though he has recently been to a costume party.  He is dressed
as a prehistoric city-dweller, with a "three-piece suit", and a "tie" wrapped
around his neck (this was a thin strip of cloth used, in prehistoric times, to
symbolize a snake -- by wrapping it about his neck, the native demonstrated
his complete triumph over the fear of boa constrictors and the like).  He
[0;1;32m is surrounded by a faintly glowing aura of leashed energy.  He is about
seven feet tall, dark-haired, with what appears to be an old fencing scar on his
left cheek.  He

six feet tall, light-haired, with what appears to be an old fishing scar on his
right cheek.  He
[0;1;32m looks like the impatient sort.  His sweaty face is a dark shade of
purple, and he seems to be tapping one foot on the ground so fast that you
can barely see it.  He
[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if he would like to
give you some crackers.  He
[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if he has a mother-in-law
named Ozelko.  He
[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet

hidden away somewhere.  He
[0;1;32m is a sharp-nosed, inquisitive-looking type, about five and a half feet
tall, with dark, oily hair.  You cannot help wondering if he is working on
a novel in his spare time.  He
[0;1;32m has become a small bread-basket, with a shelf-life of several weeks.
A small sign over his head blinks repeatedly: "Fish No More".  He
[0;1;32m is apparently undergoing a metamorphosis from the form of a
hippopotamus to that of a buttercup.  A soft wheezing sound emits from his left
armpit/leaf-structure, a portion of his anatomy you decide you would just as
soon not investigate further.  He
[0;1;32m is wearing a name-badge identifying himself as an Inspector of
Unspecified Proportionalities, but you notice that the green headdress normally
accorded such functionaries is conspicuously missing.  He
[0;1;32m has become almost uniformly orange, but you notice a small mole just
beneath his left ear that seems to be blinking on and off in a shade of
pale yellow.  He
[0;1;32m is surrounded by a cloud of small, gnat-like creatures, all singing
in unison, "When the Saints Come Marching In".  He seems to be enjoying
the music, as far as you can tell.  He
[0;1;32m has the look of a desperate fugitive about him, but you feel certain
that his mother loves him.  Looking closely, you notice a small tear forming
in the corner of his right eye.  He
[0;1;32m is apparently masquerading as the Duke of York, but the raccoon
nesting in his left ear is a dead giveaway.  He is trying to combat the smell
of the dead raccoon with Old Spice, but to no avail.  He
[0;1;32m has a serious case of Uncorgling's Disease, which makes him seem much
less unpopular than he actually is.  A spare set of kelp bladders is dangling
on a chain from his belt.  He
[0;1;32m has the look of a man plotting the overthrow of the galaxy.
Unfortunately, he cannot seem to escape the holographic image of the small
backyard rotisserie that follows him around, sometimes in front, sometimes
behind.  He
[0;1;32m has a distracted look about him, as though torn between a desire to
discover new life, new civilizations, and a desire to eat some fresh
marmalade.  Why he supposes these are mutually exclusive, you cannot tell.  He
[0;1;32m appears to be wearing a special projector that makes his nose seem
several times its actual size.  However, the small radar dome on his head
forces you to conclude that he works for the military.  He
[0;1;32m is appropriately attired for the occasion in a high-necked, stiff
white collar and blue velvet bellbottoms.  You seem to recall having seen
him before on one of those tri-D newscasts.  He
[0;1;32m has evidently gotten fed up with feeding the ducks all the time,
since he has no stale bread anywhere on his person.  However, looking closely,
you notice the telltale stains of yeast contamination on the thumb and
forefinger of his left hand.  He

[0;1;32m...Please, this is a family game -- no obscenity when talking to other players.
You can cuss at your own terminal all you like, but not over the network.
[0;1;32m...If you would like to restart your session, type "restart now".  This will
cause you to dematerialize and reappear at the city's spaceport again, as
though you were just starting the game for the first time.  Don't forget, this
means you will lose any objects you happen to be carrying at the time.
[0;1;32m...Your vision is suddenly obscured by a scintillating cloud of white mist!
You feel a whirling, swirling motion, as though you are caught in a subspace
vortex, and all of the objects you are carrying are ripped from your grasp!
Then the motion slowly subsides and your vision clears...
[0;1;32m...It's up to you to work out the details of the trade with the other player
(type "help trading" for more information).
[0;1;32m...It doesn't seem to want to open up any further than it already is.
[0;1;32m...It doesn't seem to want to close up any further than it already is.
[0;1;32m...You can't, you don't have a shovel!
[0;1;32m...Ahh, but HOW do you use it, that's the question!
[0;1;32m...Ooh, it squirmed and gasped as you did that!
[0;1;32m...You can't, you aren't wearing your jump suit!
[0;1;32m...You don't seem to be able to get a good grip.
[0;1;32m...All right you wisacre, let's stop fooling around and play the game now, huh?
[0;1;32m...Considering that, for the purpose of this game, you and I are one and the
same, that would be quite an accomplishment!
[0;1;32m...Yeah, let's swing!  Doe-si-doe now, two-by-two...
[0;1;32m...You can't, you don't seem to have a pen.
[0;1;32m...You don't seem to have a lighter.
[0;1;32m...Aaaaaah
   aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
...It doesn't seem to work.
[0;1;32m***
Suddenly, the oolgorboid begins to writhe and undulate!  Then it emits an
ear-piercing screech and lies still again.
